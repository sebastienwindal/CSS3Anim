CSS3Anim
========

A CSS3 animation presentation. Transitions, animations and how to use it from Angular.js.

Start with slides.html - the impress.js slides and then get to the demo app:

* fandingo-0.html - The angular app w/o any animation.
* fandingo-1.html - Same app with added CSS animations.
* fandingo-2.html - Animating the selected movie tile from angular using ng-class directive.
* fandingo-3.html - Animating the selected movie from angular using a custom movie-selected directive.
* fandingo-4.html - More advanced directive, a "flipping text" directive that watches for text changes and
				 animates transitions from old text to new text.
				 Also uncomment code in directive to see a _vowel colorization_ sample of firective DOM manipulation.
* form-4.html - making the point of flipping-text directive reusability point.
